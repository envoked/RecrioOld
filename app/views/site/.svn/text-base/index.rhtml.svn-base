<h2>What do I need?</h2><p>
Recrio works with Firefox, Opera, and Safari. I hope to fix the few bugs present in IE, but until then do yourself
 a favor and download <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com" target="_blank">Firefox</a>.
 

</p>
<h2>Is it free?</h2><p>
Yes. Currently Recrio is completly free with no ads.
In the future, there might be a premium version or we
might look for sponsorship.
<h2>This is cool but I wish it could...</h2>
Currently, we want to ensure that the basics are working
perfectly. Once that's done we will introduce more complex
features, but what good is being able import PSDs if you
can't save the image. If you want to the able to use the
newest features register as a beta tester and we'll contact
you when they're available.</p>
<h2>Ah it's broken</h2>
<p>If you find a bug please report it and we'll get it fixed
A.S.A.P. Also if you have any general feedback in general
please contact us. We're not perfect and we make mistakes.
